# Decisions

## 2026-09-08 — Framework: JUCE 8.0.15 + CMake + Ninja

### Context

Environment audit:

- macOS Apple Silicon, Xcode present, Ableton Live 11 Suite present
- `cmaj` / Cmajor toolchain **not** installed
- CMake and Ninja were missing; installed via Homebrew for the project

### Decision

Use **JUCE 8.0.15** fetched by CMake `FetchContent`, generator **Ninja**, C++20.

### Why not Cmajor first

Preferred progression listed Cmajor first, but the installed toolchain does not make Cmajor practical here (binary/CLI absent). Installing and learning an additional language runtime would delay a loadable AU/VST3. JUCE directly yields AU + VST3 + Standalone with host transport APIs we need.

### Why not JUCE 9.x yet

JUCE 9.0.2 exists. Pinned to **8.0.15** for a well-exercised CMake AudioPlugin example path and fewer unknowns on first bring-up. Revisit 9.x after Phase 1–2 are musically stable.

### Consequences

- Reproducible configure/build via `scripts/`
- Private prototype development is compatible with JUCE under AGPLv3 terms for non-distributed use; public/commercial distribution requires license review (`docs/LICENSING.md`)
- Composition engine stays in portable C++ under `src/generative/` for later MIDI reuse
